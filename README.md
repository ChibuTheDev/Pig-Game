# Pig Game Web App

This is a JavaScript-based web application that implements the classic dice game called "Pig." The game is played by two players taking turns to roll a dice and accumulate points. The first player to reach the predefined winning score wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Open the web app in a modern web browser.
2. The game starts with Player 1. Each turn, the player can roll the dice as many times as desired by clicking on the "Roll Dice" button.
3. The dice will generate a random number between 1 and 6.
4. If the player rolls a 1, their turn ends, and they lose all the points accumulated during that turn.
5. If the player rolls a number other than 1, that number is added to their current score, and they can choose to roll the dice again or hold their current score.
6. To hold the current score and pass the turn to the other player, the player must click on the "Hold" button.
7. The next player then takes their turn, following the same rules.
8. The first player to reach the predefined winning score (default: 100) wins the game.
